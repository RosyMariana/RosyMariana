Hi 👋 My name is Rosy Mariana
=============================

Mechanical Engineer and Web Development student
-----------------------------------------------

I have always been passionate about technology and due to my affinity with exact sciences I chose the Mechanical Engineering course to try to put all this passion into practice. However, during my journey I realized that it was programming that I found myself, so being able to work in the area became a big dream. At the end of my graduation I found at Trybe the possibility of realizing this dream and today I am a student of Web Development. I love to "code" and learn more and more every day.
